This is some software written for [Red Emma's](https://redemmas.org) that helps us schedule the shifts for our worker cooperative online.  It features:

* easy interface to add and modify shifts
* shift templates which can be applied to weeks
* workgroups with specific tasks that need to be scheduled for
* the ability to track capital account balances for worker owners
* the ability to track union-coop style "anticipated surplus" for worker owners
* an admin user class that has special powers around money/user/worker stuff
* lots of nice reporting, with more likely to come
